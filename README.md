Flukybot
============

Yup, you can run a Telegram bot locally in your own browser using JavaScript. No need to install anything since you already have a browser. You're not likely to have your browser online all the time though, so the bot might be a bit fluky. This is mainly a proof-of-concept and a way to experiment with the Bot API with JavaScript.
